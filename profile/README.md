## The goal

For a long time osu! tournaments had to be organized on Google Sheets or Excel which often brings many curbs and challenges alongside a dish of bugs and errors. 
Now this is where Pyrothia comes in.
The goal is ultimately remove the need for any kind of sheet like mappooling, refing, managing, and replaying/playtesting. This will all happen with Pyrothia, which will not only replace sheets but also bring fourth features that will make tournaments much more friendly and streamlined for both new and veteran players.
